I am a third year PhD student in the [Harvard Statistics Department](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/). During my PhD I have also been fortunate to work with [Ariel Procaccia](https://procaccia.info/) and [Mark Sellke](https://msellke.com/).

Prior to coming to Harvard, I completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University in Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE), where I worked with [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). After graduating from Princeton, I worked for two years as a quantitative researcher at Radix Trading.
