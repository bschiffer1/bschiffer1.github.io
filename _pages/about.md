I am a third year PhD student in the [Harvard Statistics Department](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/). During my PhD I have also been fortunate to work with [Ariel Procaccia](https://procaccia.info/) and [Mark Sellke](https://msellke.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning, computational social choice, and decision-making under uncertainty. I am particularly interested in understanding how fairness and safety considerations impact statistical learning, and I have previously worked on learning problems in control theory, preference aggregation, and online fair division.

Prior to coming to Harvard, I completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University in Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE), where I worked with [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). After graduating from Princeton, I worked for two years as a quantitative researcher at Radix Trading.
