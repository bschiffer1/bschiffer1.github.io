I am a third year PhD student in the [Harvard Statistics Department](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/). I completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University in Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE), where I worked with [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). After graduating, I worked for two years as a quantitative researcher at Radix Trading.
